# Projeto Backend NodeJS - API-Vendas

Este projeto apresenta uma api de vendas desenvolvida em TS com NodeJS.
Nele Ã© utilizado conseitos de Clean Arquitecture, Domain Driven Design e muito mais.

## Main Technologies Used:


**NodeJS:** Is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts.

**Express:** Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

**PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database

**Jest:** For unit and integration testing.


## Benefits of the DTO Pattern and Layered Architecture:

**Separation of Responsibilities:** Each layer has a clear responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

**Code Reuse:** Domain classes, DTOs and repositories can be reused in different parts of the application.

**Flexibility and Scalability:** The layered architecture allows you to scale specific parts of the application as needed, without affecting other parts.

**Testability:** Separation of responsibilities makes it easier to write unit and integration tests for each component of the application.

With this structure, the project is well organized and prepared to deal with the complexity and requirements of a modern application based on Spring Boot and MongoDB.
